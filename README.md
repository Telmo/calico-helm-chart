# Calico Helm Chart

I took AWS/EKS Calico Installation file that you can find here https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/calico.html and split it into few files that make up the whole Helm Chart.

I have not worked on creating values.yaml file and templating it much, so if you have suggestions or time, feel free to update it. I just used the helm chart to test few things with automated Deployment.
